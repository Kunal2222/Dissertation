                    <h1>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</h1>
                    <h4>Robert T. Kiyosaki</h4>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years of 
               undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on to Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University 
               to do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth grade. Both men were successful 
               in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled financially. The other would become one 
               of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and his church. The other left bills to be paid. 
               Both men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in 
               education but did not recommend the same course of study. If I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. Having two dads 
               offered me the choice of contrasting points of view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man. Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, 
               I found myself thinking more, comparing, and then choosing for myself. The problem was that the rich man was not rich yet, and the poor man Introduction 
               2 was not yet poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families. But they had very different points of 
               view about money. For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.” 
               As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same things. 
               The contrast in their points of view, particularly about money, was so extreme that I grew curious and intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time 
               about what each was saying. Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same question 
               of the other dad’s statement. It would have been much easier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply reject the point of view by saying, 
               “The old man doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As 
               a process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in the long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view. One of the reasons the 
               rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money 
               from our parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money? They simply say, “Stay in school and study hard.” The child may graduate with excellent grades, 
               but with a poor person’s financial programming and mindset. Sadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and professional skills, but not on financial skills. 
               This explains how smart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades may struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due in large part 
               to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial decisions with little or no training in the subject of money. Rich Dad Poor Dad 3 Today I often wonder 
               what will soon happen when we have millions of people who need financial and medical assistance. They will be dependent upon their families or the government for financial 
               support. What will happen when Medicare and Social Security run out of money? How will a nation survive if teaching children about money continues to be left to parents—most 
               of whom will be, or already are, poor? Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had to think about each dad’s advice, and in doing so, I gained
               valuable insight into the power and effect of one’s thoughts on one’s life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other dad forbade
               those words to be used. He insisted I ask, “How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces 
               you to think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words “I can’t afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the question 
               <br>
               <br>
               “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work. He did not mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical about exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the world. He’d say, “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that automatically saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness. Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of putting his brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long-term result was that one dad grew stronger financially, and the other grew weaker. It is not much different from a person who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone who sits on the couch watching television. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. My two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected the way they thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more in taxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other said, “Taxes punish those who produce and reward those who don’t produce.” Introduction 4 One dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to work for.” The other recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to buy.” One dad said, “The reason I’m not rich is because I have you kids.” The other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have you kids.” One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner table, while the other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal. One said, “When it comes to money, play it safe. Don’t take risks.” The other said, “Learn to manage risk.” One believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our greatest asset.” The other believed, “My house is a liability, and if your house is your largest investment, you’re in trouble.” Both dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while the other paid his bills last. One dad believed in a company or the government taking care of you and your needs. He was always concerned about pay raises, retirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days, and other perks. He was impressed with two of his uncles who joined the military and earned a retirement-and-entitlement package for life after twenty years of active service. He loved the idea of medical benefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also loved the tenure system available through the university. The idea of job protection for life and job benefits seemed more important, at times, than the job. He would often say, “I’ve worked hard for the government, and I’m entitled to these benefits.” The other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against the entitlement mentality and how it created weak and financially needy people. He was emphatic about being financially competent. One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created investments. One dad taught me how to write an impressive resumé so I could find a good job. The other taught me how to write strong business and financial plans so I could create jobs. Rich Dad Poor Dad 5 Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of observing the effects different thoughts have on one’s life. I noticed that people really do shape their lives through their thoughts. For example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And that prophecy became reality. My rich dad, on the other hand, always referred to himself as rich. He would say things like, “I’m a rich man, and rich people don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a major financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man. He would cover himself by saying, “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.” My poor dad would say, “I’m not interested in money,” or “Money doesn’t matter.” My rich dad always said, “Money is power.” The power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, but it became obvious to me as a young boy that it was important to be aware of my thoughts and how I expressed myself. I noticed that my poor dad was poor, not because of the amount of money he earned, which was significant, but because of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy having two fathers, I became acutely aware of being careful about which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own. Should I listen to my rich dad or to my poor dad? Although both men had tremendous respect for education and learning, they disagreed about what they thought was important to learn. One wanted me to study hard, earn a degree, and get a good job to earn money. He wanted me to study to become a professional, an attorney or an accountant, and to go to business school for my MBA. The other encouraged me to study to be rich, to understand how money works, and to learn how to have it work for me. “I don’t work for money!” were words he would repeat over and over. “Money works for me!” At the age of nine, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad about money. In doing so, I chose not to listen to my poor dad, even though he was the one with all the college degrees. There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal. 
               “Dad, can you tell me how to get rich?”
               My dad put down the evening paper. “Why do you want to get
               rich, Son?”
               “Because today Jimmy’s mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and
               they were going to their beach house for the weekend. He took three
               of his friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited. They told us we weren’t
               invited because we were poor kids.”
               “They did?” my dad asked incredulously.
               “Yeah, they did,” I replied in a hurt tone.
               My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his
               nose, and went back to reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer.
               The year was 1956. I was nine years old. By some twist of fate,
               I attended the same public school where the rich people sent their
               kids. We were primarily a sugar-plantation town. The managers of
               the plantation and the other affluent people, such as doctors, business
               owners, and bankers, sent their children to this elementary school.
               After grade six, their children were generally sent off to private
               schools. Because my family lived on one side of the street, I went
               to this school. Had I lived on the other side of the street, I would

               10
               have gone to a different school with kids from families more like
               mine. After grade six, these kids and I would go on to the public
               intermediate and high school. There was no private school for them
               or for me.
               My dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking.
               “Well, Son…,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have
               to learn to make money.”
               “How do I make money?” I asked.
               “Well, use your head, Son,” he said, smiling. Even then I knew
               that really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell you,” or “I don’t know
               the answer, so don’t embarrass me.”
               A Partnership Is Formed
               The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had
               said. As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this
               school. Mike was also in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had
               drawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in
               school with the rich kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we
               were because all the other boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles,
               new everything.
               Mom and Dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter,
               and clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to say, “If you want
               something, work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not much
               work available for nine-year-old boys.
               “So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.
               “I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?”
               He agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my
               first business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas
               on how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the “cool
               guys” at Jimmy’s beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt
               was good, because it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make
               money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck. It was an
               idea Mike got from a science book he had read. Excitedly, we shook
               hands, and the partnership now had a business.

               11
               For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood,
               knocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their
               toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a
               smile. Some asked us what we were doing, to which we replied, “We can’t
               tell you. It’s a business secret.”
               My mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a
               site next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our
               raw materials. In a brown cardboard box that at one time held catsup
               bottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.
               Finally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’
               messy, crumpled, used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you
               boys doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to hear again that it’s a business
               secret. Do something with this mess, or I’m going to throw it out.”
               Mike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon
               have enough and then we would begin production.
